# CIS4130_Semester_Project
For this semester-long project, students will build a complete machine learning pipeline that incorporates big data technologies using a cloud infrastructure.  The project is split into 7 milestones that will be due throughout the semester.

In this project, I employed the use of Amazon Web Services (AWS) and the programming language Python to develop a Logistic Regression model. This model is able to accurately predict the classification of various cartoons based on a set of input data. By leveraging the power of AWS and the flexibility of Python, I was able to train and fine-tune the model to achieve high levels of accuracy in its predictions.
